    "<p>COVID-19, an infectious coronavirus disease, has spread throughout the whole world in a short amount of time since the end of 2019 and led to an ongoing pandemic. It significantly influenced all aspects of people's daily life. As of 1/29/2021, more than a hundred million people in the world have been infected with the virus, and more than two million of them have died from it. In order to solve this problem, scientists, businesses, and global health organizations are working together to try to find a vaccine that will be safe and effective against the virus. So far, a lot of vaccines have been reported to be effective and open to the public for vaccinating. According to the statistics provided, the vaccine from both China and the USA has an 80% chance to prevent infection.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>As it is commonly known, COVID-19 has mainly spread through community transmission. Therefore, it will be necessary for governments to set restrictions in order to slow the speed of spreading. For example, California State Government gave the Stay Home Order in March 2020 that required the citizens to stay at home unless it was for essential jobs or needs. They also issued a requirement to wear a mask in public spaces. While these restrictions helped the speed of spreading to be slower, it also caused chaos and dissatisfactions among the citizens as some of them felt their freedom was deprived. Hence, our team wonders whether there could be an alternative solution that could satisfy these people while slowing the spread? Therefore, we formulate a hypothesis that, if more people inside the country can get the vaccine, it may inhibit the rapid spread of the virus. </p>\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that the countries that have more people vaccinated will have a smaller number of COVID-19 new confirmed cases, comparing to the countries which have fewer number of people vaccinated or the countries which do not have vaccinaition. The number of people vaccinated of countries and the number of new confirmed cases of those countries have negative relationship. \n",

    "We chose this hypothesis because the current vaccines have proven to be useful and thus should be effective in controlling the current condition. As more people are vaccinated, the possibility of viruses spreading widely is expected to be reduced."
