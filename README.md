# Covid-19 Vaccine Effectiveness Analysis

This is the final project for COGS108 Data Science in Practice @UCSD.

As this group project spanned the entire quarter, it was splited into several phases by some check points. When a certain check point was reached, the corresponding file could no longer be edited and was submitted for any feedbacks possible.
